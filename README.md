# GoSLIDE

GoSLIDE is a Go module implementing the Sub-Linear Deep learning Engine (SLIDE) algorithm introduced by [Chen et al, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03129).

This is a **work-in-progress** port from the original 
[codebase](https://github.com/keroro824/HashingDeepLearning), written in C++.

Once we have a first complete port, we expect
to focus on cleaning, refactoring, testing, and maybe even re-engineering
some components. Eventually, we will evaluate further expansions, and a
possible integration or combination with the
[spago](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago) library.
